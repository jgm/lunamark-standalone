This is a standalone version of [lunamark](https://github.com/jgm/lunamark).

It can be compiled on any system with lua libraries. The resulting executable
does not depend on shared libraries; everything needed is statically linked.

Part of the motivation for this is that I needed to tweak lpeg for further
lunamark development. This way I can simply statically link in the modified
version of lpeg.

Installation should also be simpler.
