Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]
This should *not* be a footnote reference, because it
contains a space.[^my note]

[^longnote]: Here&#39;s the long note.  This one contains multiple
blocks.

    Subsequent blocks are indented to show that they belong to the
footnote (as with list items).

          { <code> }

    If you want, you can indent every line, but you can also be
    lazy and just indent the first line of each block.

This paragraph should not be part of the note, as it is not indented.

  [^1]: Here is the footnote.  It can go anywhere after the footnote
  reference.  It need not be placed at the end of the document.
